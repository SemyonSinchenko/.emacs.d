## Context & Problem
${2:Why are we building this? What is the business value?}

## Expected Behavior
${3:Describe the "Happy Path". What exactly should the system do?}

## User / System Flow
1. ${4:Step 1: User/System triggers X...}
2. $5

## Technical Constraints & Pointers
> [!NOTE] 
> AI Guidelines for design.md generation.
* **Target Domain/Files:** ${6:Which existing files or modules should be modified? e.g., src/api/auth.ts}
* **Restrictions:** ${7:e.g., Strictly use native fetch, do NOT add new npm dependencies.}

## Out of Scope
* ${8:What are we strictly NOT doing? (Crucial to prevent AI over-engineering)}

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
* **If ${9:condition/failure}:** ${10:System should do Y...}

## Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] ${11:Criterion 1 (AI will use these to generate tasks.md)}
* [ ] $12
